A simple Python calculator using Tkinter for a clean, responsive GUI and basic operations.

(i). Abstract :- The project created a calculator application using Tkinter, offering a straightforward interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. The design includes a grid layout with buttons for digits, operators, parentheses, and essential functions like evaluation and clearing. The application features robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and computation errors. By focusing on a clean and responsive design, the calculator ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience for performing calculations.

(ii). Design :- 
The design of the calculator application utilizes Tkinter to create a user-friendly interface with a grid layout. The main components include a large text area at the top for displaying calculations and results. Below, a grid of buttons is arranged for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, X, /), parentheses, and functions for evaluation and clearing. Buttons are uniformly styled with consistent font and size to ensure readability and ease of interaction. The layout is designed to be clear and intuitive, facilitating efficient user operation.
